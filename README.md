# Insert_URL

##Motivation for This Project

I was growing increasingly tired of having to navigating directories to find my website pages to add a new link 
that directs vistors to a new project mine. 

Then I had to wait for the HTML page to load up, and then I needed to getting the formatting right to
ensure my hyperlink would work.

Seems like a task for a computer right? 

So I put my Python scripting skills to the test and I made a script to insert the URL as a hyperlink in an html page. 

This project is very specific to me since I set the formatting to follow that of the list I 
use in my web page.

However, it can readily be modified for your needs.

I hope this project shows how even the simplest lines of code can help automate tasks that could be eating 
your motivation for programming. 

##Future Improvements

- I need to determine a way to just append a line directly below another file
  line since currently my program adds a new line, but in order for that line
  to be processed all the lines must be rewritten again, which is resource 
  intensive, so I need to find a more efficient method.
- I want to see if for the path directory it will accept aliases I wrote in my bashrc
  because it will cause more time to be saved from having to do a "pwd" command to
  find the directory the file I want to edit is located in.
